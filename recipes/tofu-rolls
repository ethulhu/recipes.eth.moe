title: tofu Rolls

needs:
 - 1 pack firm tofu
 - 1 diced onion
 - 120g fresh white breadcrumbs (approx 3 slices of bread)
 - 3 tsp dried sage
 - 1 tsp dried thyme
 - 75g dried cranberries
 - 100ml sherry
 - 1 tbsp arrowroot powder
 - 500g pack vegan puff pastry
 - 2 tbsp soya cream
 - 1 tbsp maple syrup
 - plain flour to dust

steps:
 - fry the onions.
 - blend the tofu, sage, thyme, breadcrumbs, sherry, cooked onions, and arrowroot powder.
 - stir in the cranberries.
 - roll out the pastry to approx 40cm by 20cm, 5mm thick.
 - spread the filling down the middle of the pastry, "a long sausage shape".
 - mix the maple syrup and cream to make a glaze.
 - brush the glaze onto the long edges of the pastry, then fold one side over the filling, pressing firmly, then the other, sealing the pastry.
 - roll the pastry over so the seam is on the bottom.
 - cut the roll into 12 pieces, and make two little slashes in the top of each roll with a knife.
 - brush the top of each with the glaze, and bake at 180Â°C for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
 - serve with a cranberry sauce dip.
