- 1 tsp salt
- pinch freshly-ground black pepper

steps:
- preheat oven to 180C.
- line a loaf tin in butter and flour.
- mix together the flour, cheese, pistachios, and prunes.
- in a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until fluffy and pale in color.
- gradually whisk in the oil, milk, and yoghurt.
- season with salt and black pepper.
- fold the dry mixture into the wet. don't overbeat as the end result will be tough (it’s better to undermix).
- pour the batter into the prepared tin.
